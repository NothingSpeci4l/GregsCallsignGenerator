# Greg's Callsign Generator
## Description
"Greg's Callsign Generator" is an application designed to generate callsigns. It proves especially useful when performing non-realistic (fictional) flights, allowing you to use more realistic callsigns on networks such as IVAO or VATSIM.

You have two operating modes:

Type 1: Generates a callsign in the format ICAO 99 ZZ (e.g., AFR35LT).
Type 2: Generates a callsign in the format ICAO 9999 (e.g., ENT5232).
In both modes, you can choose how many digits your callsign can contain!

## Requirements & Utilization
Since this software is coded in Java, you need JRE 1.8 to run it. 

After downloading, you will have a .jar file. If Java is properly installed, you just need to run it!
If nothing happens, it means Java was not installed correctly.

✅ Windows 

✅ OSX

✅ Linux
